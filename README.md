# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Python project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
